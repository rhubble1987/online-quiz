# Description

For this homework, we were to put together a timed online quiz that would dynamically display questions and answers and give users a their score after they have finished. 

# User Guide
1. Click 'Start'
2. Read the question and select your answer
3. When the timer is up or you have answered all of the questions, you will be shown your score
4. You can also enter your name and click save to have your score saved

# Approach

For this assignment, I started by putting together the basic HTML layout for the quiz. After this, I psuedocoded out the process that the user would follow to complete the quiz. After thinking about many different approaches, I decided to rely heavily on call back functions as these were clearer to me when trying to produce the dynamic functionality of the quiz.

# Challenges

The most challenging aspect of this was figuring out the storage and retrieval of past scores. I was able to save entries to local storage, but I wasn't successful in getting the scores to show up on subsequent refreshes.
